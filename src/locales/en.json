  "about": {
    "firstParagraph": "I learned C++ to build a stock market prediction system using artificial neural networks. While this is a project I still support and use, it led me to unique jurney through brighter and darker sides of software development. My exposure to legacy systems codebase led me to shift towards radical simplicity.",

      "year": "2014",
      "description": "I was tasked with database-wide undo feature implementation which I accomplished by developing a T-SQL generator based on table schema which allowed a generation of undo procedure for each of hundreds of tables. Other tasks were related to C++ codebase refactoring and bugfixing."

      "title": "Transactor Poland - (Junior) Software Developer",
      "period": "2014 to 2017",
      "description": "I started as a Junior Developer and was promoted to Regular Developer after successfully delivering first project — a WPF business intelligence application that aggregated data from multiple APIs, providing significant value to the customer at a low cost. Following this, I worked in an Agile team on an end-to-end insurance lifetime management system, handling development, refactoring, bug fixing, and unit testing. A major part of my role involved working with T-SQL stored procedures, WCF services, ASP.NET APIs, WPF, Windows Forms, XSLT, XSD, VB.NET, and SQLite. I participated in multiple third-party integrations, including payment providers and data enrichment services, ensuring interoperability between systems. Throughout this role, I gained experience in wide range of technologies like performance and SQL profiling, WCF, WWF, XSLTs, SOAP and many more."

      "description": "Continuation of previous employment under different brand. More focus on newer technologies, we used ASP.NET Core over WCF, RabbitMQ instead of WWF, more Azure over on premise, MongoDB over MS SQL. A significant challenge was modernizing an archaic VB6 application, which we successfully achieved by splitting and migrating logic into WPF-based microservices while heavilly unit - testing existing functionality and moving slowly by first hosting the old Windows Application over Azure Virtual Desktop and then, when all the services were stable and tested we connected a modern frontend."

The stimulator is programmable via COM and featured 2 gloves with 5 tactile stimulators, each controllable separately {sourceLink1}. I classified the monkey awake states in Python's Keras with accuracy above 0.8 after applying FFT and other transformations to raw EEG time series {sourceLink2}."

      "title": "Seville More Helory Polska - Senior Software Developer",
      "period": "since 2020",
      "description": "I joined a project implementing document source control - the end goal was a Git alike experience and bespoke parsing of .docx format, allowing document modifications without Word. My main responsibility was implemeting the functionalities in C# Web.API and over time wireing Search, Service Bus and Redis, implementing custom intermediate response cache layer on CosmosDb and improving performance of multitude of workflows, which I was very successful in. When the project finished, I was trusted with planning and implementing the architecture of a bespoke process for a new key client. I had to make critical design choices early on without having the full scope of requirements as well as decide on priorities o ensure smooth front-end and backend interoperability. My approach ensured flexibility, allowing us to adapt seamlessly as the project evolved. Beyond development, I played a key role in preventing misguided technical decisions, ex. when leadership pushed for excessive encoding I took a step back, investigated the root cause, and resolved the issue by removing few lines of code, avoiding covering the issue with multitude of new ones. My tech stack includes C# with CosmosDB, along with Azure services such as Service Bus, Redis Cache, AI Search and more. Over the years, I have designed and executed countless database migrations, refining my expertise in agile NoSQL architecture—ensuring models remain adaptable to changing requirements while remaining efficient and easy to migrate."
