      "title": "Transactor Poland - (Junior) Software Developer",
      "period": "2014 - 2017",
      "description": "I started as a Junior Software Developer and was promoted to Regular after successfully delivering first project â€” a WPF business intelligence application that aggregated data from multiple APIs, providing significant value to the customer at a low cost. Following this, I worked in an Agile team on an end-to-end insurance lifetime management system, handling development, refactoring, bug fixing, and unit testing. A major part of my role involved working with T-SQL stored procedures, WCF services, ASP.NET APIs, WPF, Windows Forms, XSLT, XSD, VB.NET, and SQLite. I participated in multiple third-party integrations, including payment providers and data enrichment services, ensuring interoperability between systems. Throughout this role, I gained experience in a wide range of technologies like performance and SQL profiling, WCF, WWF (Windows Workflow Foundation), XSLTs, SOAP and many more. For project management and collaboration I used AzureDevops (VSTS at the time), Trello, Jira and Zendesk."

      "title": "Open GI - Software Developer",
      "period": "2017 - 2019",
      "description": "Continuation of previous employment under different brand. More focus on newer technologies, we used ASP.NET Core over WCF, RabbitMQ instead of WWF, more Azure over on premise, MongoDB over MS SQL. A significant challenge was modernizing legacy VB6 application, which we successfully achieved by splitting and migrating logic into WPF-based microservices while heavily unit-testing existing functionality and moving slowly by first hosting the old Windows Application over Azure Virtual Desktop and then, when all the services were stable and tested we connected a modern frontend."

The stimulator features 2 gloves with 5 efectors, each controllable separately via COM and  [source](https://github.com/PFalkowski/HapticStimulatorPCA9685).

      "title": "Seville More Helory Polska - Senior Software Developer",
      "period": "since 2020",
      "description": "My main responsibility was implementing the document version control in C# ASP.NET API, developing solutions using Azure AI (Cognitive) Search, Azure Service Bus and Redis Cache, improving performance and implementing custom optimizations like intermediate cache layer on CosmosDb. Later, I was trusted with code architecture and implementation of a bespoke process for a new key client - I made correct key design choices early on with limited scope of requirements as well as decided on priorities to ensure smooth front-end and backend interoperability. My data architecture ensured flexibility, allowing us to adapt seamlessly as the project evolved, ensuring models remain adaptable to changing requirements while remaining efficient."
